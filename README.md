# iterator-test

This is a small assignment that contains one simple assignment that could be
part of a company's coding tests.

## Assignment

Implement a flattened iterator, i.e. a class that takes any number of iterators
and present them as one single iterator.

I.e. if you have one iterator that will produce the series 1, 2, 3, 4 and
another one that will produce 5, 6, 7 the flattened iterator will give you
one iterator producing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

You should do this by adding your own code to FlattenedIterator. All 
unit tests should pass.
